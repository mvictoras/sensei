# ISC 2019

In 2019, we presented a [half-day tutorial](https://2019.isc-program.com/presentation/?id=tut141&sess=sess126)
on SENSEI at the [ISC HPC conference](https://www.isc-hpc.com/).
The [course materials](https://data.kitware.com/#collection/5a007cb58d777f31ac64ddfd/folder/5cf7f50f8d777f072b15eae5)
are available here:

+ [Slides (PDF, 57 MB)](https://data.kitware.com/api/v1/item/5cf7f5268d777f072b15eaf1/download)
+ [Virtual machine disk image (OVA, 8.9GB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N1OoynU8dADIXoY5YEQ5VtrSayCO4qDS)

The disk image is based on Ubuntu 18.04 and can be used with VirtualBox to try SENSEI out
without having to build it yourself.
However, once you decide to use it with your simulation,
you should build it yourself to avoid the overhead of a virtual machine.

For those who attended the tutorial at ISC,
we also had temporary accounts and a small reservation set up on
[Cori @ NERSC, a real supercomputer,](https://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/cori/)
that you could use to try out SENSEI during the tutorial!
We have found this a useful way to provide access to SENSEI
without large downloads.
